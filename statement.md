1. Title of the Project

Currency Converter Application 

2. Overview of the Project

This project is a simple and effective Python-based application designed to convert an amount from one currency to another using real-time exchange rates. The system will ask for user input of the amount to be converted and the type of currency, connect to an online API, fetch the live values of exchange, and show the result of conversion instantaneously. It is built to help users perform quick and accurate conversions in a user-friendly manner.

3. Problem Statement

Many users face problems when trying to correctly calculate currency values, mainly due to great or rapid fluctuations in currency rates. Manual calculation is cumbersome and leads to incorrect results. This project consequently tries to solve that problem by offering an automated program using real-time data to convert any currency speedily and with a high degree of accuracy.

4. Objectives

To create a Python application capable of converting currencies using live exchange rates.

Understand and implement API integration

To provide a simple, interactive, and exact conversion tool

Using try and catch blocks to ensure error handling and smooth user experience.

5. Scope of the Project

It will also support real-time conversion between international currencies using any open, free currency exchange API. The project should allow repeated conversions in a single program run and handle invalid inputs gracefully.

6. Technologies Used

Python

Requests Library (for API calls)

ExchangeRate API

7. Expected Output

Correct converted currency value

Clear and understandable outcomes

Continuous conversion until user chooses to exit
